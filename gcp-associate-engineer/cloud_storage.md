## Storage

### Block storage

**Block storage or Persistence disk** are network-attached block storage devices that can be used with VMs and provide
storage for instances running on GCE and GKE.

#### Key features

- **Highly durable and available**: by design block storage is highly durable and data is replicated within its zone
  protecting from hardware failure.
- **Variety of options**: HDD for moderate IO/sec (IOPS) and SSD for high-IOPS;
- **Scalable**: block storage can scale up to 64TB and dynamically resized without any downtime.
- **Encryption**: each disk is encrypted with key that are managed by Cloud KMS.
- **Snapshots**: snapshots can be created for backups and restore.
- **Shaped persistent disks**: read-only or read-write disks can be connected simultaneously to multiple VMs that makes
  it useful for parallel processing or clustered software.

### File storage

**File storage or Cloud Filestore** is a manage file storage service for applications that require a traditional file
system interface and a shared file system. Provides simple native experience for managed NAS.

#### Key features

- **High performance**: based on the service tier, provides high IOPS and throughput, specifically for applications
  requiring high-speed file-based workload.
- **Fully managed**: Google Cloud managed the underlying infrastructure, including hading the setup of file systems,
  capacity planning, hardware and software tuning etc.
- **Network Attached Storage (NAS)**: filestore instances are available across the entire network, making it easier to
  manage files centrally in applications with distributed microservices architectures.
- **Compatibility**: filestore uses standard NFS protocol, meaning that applications running on virtually any OS can use
  it.
- **Backups and restore**: secure backup and restore of filestore instances.

### Object storage

**Object storage or Cloud Storage** is the service allowing to store and retrieve any type of data as objects. Objects
are stored in bucket containers that can follow a hierarchical folder structure that provide expanded access to groups
of objects with a shared name prefix.

#### Key features

- **Scalability**: Cloud storage is design to scale based on the request demand, meaning in can handle large amount of
  data ad high request rates.
- **Durability and availability**: offers high durability and availability of data, by automatically replicating data
  across multiple geographical dispersed regions.
- **Security**: Cloud storage provides strong security features with multiple layers of security to protect data
  including encryption at rest and in transit, IAM controls, and audit logs.
- **Versioning**: objects stored in Cloud storage can be versioned and retained as a non-current version. This is useful
  in case an object was deleted accidentally, it can be restored from the version.
- **Lifecycle**: Cloud storage supports object lifecycle configurations, providing a mechanism to automatically perform
  an action on an object after a certain time period have past, e.g. archive or delete an object after a month.

| Streaming Transfers | Uploading or downloading only the bytes that you want or need.                        |

#### Uniform bucket-level access (UBLA)

**Uniform bucket-level access** is a feature allowing to manage bucket and object access. Instead of managing access
control on each object individually, UBLA simplifies access management by enabling bucket-level access management.

When enabled, Access Control Lists (ACLs) are disabled for all objects in the bucket. All newly created objects in the
bucket will inherit the bucket's Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, and you won't be able to grant access to
objects using ACLs.
